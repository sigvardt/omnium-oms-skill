# Omnium OMS Skill

A Claude Code skill that provides complete reference documentation for the [Omnium OMS](https://docs.omnium.no) (Order Management System) platform.

## What is this?

This skill gives Claude Code deep knowledge of the Omnium OMS API and platform — endpoints, data models, integration patterns, and domain concepts. When installed, Claude can answer questions about Omnium and help you build integrations without constantly referring to external docs.

## When does it activate?

The skill triggers when you mention anything related to Omnium OMS, including:

- Order management, cart/checkout flows, customer management (B2C/B2B)
- Product catalog, inventory, pricing, promotions
- Purchase orders, stores/markets, notifications, analytics
- Omnium-specific concepts like workflow steps, click & collect, delta queries, scroll search
- Any Omnium API endpoint
